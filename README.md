### PopularMovies

Check out what movies are popular. You can sort by popularity or by user rating.<br><br>

The app uses the TMDb API for movies and movie detais. To get it working, an API key has to be provided. This can be retrieved form 'https://www.themoviedb.org/' by following the instructions provided there. After receiving the key, place it within the '<string name="api_key_value">[Your API key here]</string>' tag found in the strings resource file (app>src>main>res>values>strings.xml)<br>

<b>Have fun!</b>
